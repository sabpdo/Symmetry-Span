Symmetry Span Task
---------------------

The experiment:

	In this task participants are required to memorise a sequence of square locations. Square position presentation is interrupted by symmetry trails. In symmetry trials participants are required to judge whether the presented picture is vertically symmetrical. Square presentation and symmetry trials are repeated until participants are asked to recall all square locations in sequential order. This experiment is based on Kane et al. (2004) experiment. This experiment differs from the original experiment in number of trials.

Analysing your data:

	Data is stored in the excel file produced by PsychoPy in the data folder. sym_resp.corr column includes data from symmetry trials. 1 represents correct response and 0 reperesents incorrect response. sym_resp.rt column includes the reaction time for each trial. square_correct column includes data from the memory trials, with 1 indicating correct response and 0 indicating incorrect response. square_resp.clicked_name shows excatly which square was selected by participants.
